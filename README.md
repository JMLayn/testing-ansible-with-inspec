# Effective Testing with Ansible and InSpec

Ansible is an incredibly easy way to manage infrastructure and configuration. But what's the best way to ensure the changes to your Ansible playbooks have the intended outcome and do not introduce unwanted changes? And how can you verify your your playbook changes do not negatively impact the compliance status of your infrastructure?

In this session, we will learn about InSpec and how it's incredibly easy-to-read language allows for integration and compliance requirements to be expressed as code. We will look at how Test Kitchen and InSpec can be used to validate your Ansible playbooks and empower developers to test for compliance earlier in the development cycle. Additionally, we will also explore how to use and modify InSpec profiles created by others.

This repository includes code used in the [Effective Testing with Ansible and InSpec talk given at Configuration Management Camp 2018](http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/ansible/nathen-harvey.html).
